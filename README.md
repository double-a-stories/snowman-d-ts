# @types/snowman

This repository provides Typescript definitions for the [Snowman 2](https://github.com/videlais/snowman/) Twine story format. This could be useful if you're writing a story in TypeScript. For me, it makes the squiggly lines go away while writing JS modules for my story.

Consider this a pre-alpha, no warranty, etc.. Snowman-2 pollutes global namespace a lot, so we just `declare` a bunch of stuff (not recommended!). At some point, I want to write my own fork in TS with better namespacing and type safety (like Snowman 3, which is currently abandoned).
